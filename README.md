__**ZarcFit: Impedance Analysis of Rock Samples**__

A user-friendly tool for researchers to analyze and fit experimental impedance data of rock samples using theoretical electronic circuit models.

This is a Python reworking and update of the original ZarcFit program, which was developed in LabView by Dr. Enkin in 2014. The program remains under development to meet his specifications.

**Features**

-Implements two theoretical circuit models to represent rock sample impedance.
-Provides graphical visualization of experimental vs. modeled data.
-Supports interactive parameter adjustments through color-coded sliders.
-Uses a configuration file (config.ini) for easy parameter tuning.
-Written in Python, offering improved flexibility and maintainability over the original LabView version.

**Usage**

Understanding the Models

The theoretical foundation of the models can be found in the attached image (circuit_models.jpg), which displays the circuit representations used.
The green line in the graphs represents the experimental impedance data.
The blue curve represents the modeled impedance data.
Adjusting Parameters

The color-coded sliders allow tuning of impedance parameters:
Red, Green, and Blue sliders represent high, medium, and low-frequency Zarcs.
Black sliders adjust external circuit components such as electrode effects.
Configuration & Customization

The config.ini file enables quick access to adjustable parameters without modifying the code.
The hardcoded circuit models, as per Dr. Enkinâ€™s request, are implemented in Calculator.py and are designed for easy readability.
